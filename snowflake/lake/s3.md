[Configuring secure access to Amazon S3](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-s3-config)


## [option 1](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-s3-config-storage-integration#configuring-secure-access-to-cloud-storage): by storage integration (recommended)
- Reuse: A single storage integration can support multiple s3 stages.
- TODO: official guide is a SOP, can we automate it?

- By integration creation, Snowflake provisions a single IAM user for your entire Snowflake account. All S3 storage integrations in your account use that IAM user.


## option 2: by credential
Configure an AWS IAM user to access your S3 bucket
- with AWS key and secret key.
